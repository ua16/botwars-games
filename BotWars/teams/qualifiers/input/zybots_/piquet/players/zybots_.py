# Apex Piquet player — strategic exchange, optimal declarations, tracked trick play.
#
# Strategy notes:
#   - Declare phase: only the WINNING claim's details are ever revealed to the
#     engine's public `declarations` log (see engine._resolve_declaration /
#     _claim_summary). A losing claim leaks nothing. So there is never a
#     downside to claiming whenever you hold a valid combination — this bot
#     always does, and never passes with something to show.
#   - Exchange phase: cards are scored by how much they contribute to your
#     best point-suit, best sequence, and best set, plus a small baseline for
#     raw trick-taking strength (high cards win tricks). The weakest-scoring
#     cards are discarded up to the maximum allowed each turn.
#   - Trick phase: the bot remembers every card it has seen played this hand
#     (built up call-by-call from `current_trick`, since it acts every trick).
#     Combined with its own hand, this tells it exactly which cards of a suit
#     are still unaccounted for (i.e. must be in the opponent's hand or yet
#     to be played). It leads guaranteed winners cheaply, otherwise leads low
#     from its longest suit; when following it wins as cheaply as possible or
#     ducks with its lowest card if it can't beat the lead.
